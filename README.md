# Simple Chatbot with Tkinter GUI

This is a simple chatbot implemented in Python using spaCy for natural language processing and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

pip install spacy tk

Also, download the spaCy English model:

Running the Chatbot
To run the chatbot, execute the following command:

This will open a Tkinter window with a chat interface. Type your messages in the input field, press the "Send" button, and the chatbot will respond.

Feel free to customize the chatbot by modifying the get_response function in the code. You can add more rules and responses to make the chatbot more interactive.
